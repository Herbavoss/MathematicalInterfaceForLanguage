Mathematical Interface For Language
================================

For The Mathematical Interface on Language we assign numbers to the 10 parts of sentence construction 
For The english language.

Use this interface to build parse-syntax-grammar enabled software solutions.  

This Mathematical Interface For Language will help those building correct sentence structure communication syntax tools.

    The following are numeric math-like variables of proper syntax of Quantum Language assigned to the 
    9 aspects of sentence construction.
    ___________________________________
    
        0 = CONJUNCTION
        1 = ADVERB
        2 = VERB
        3 = ADJECTIVE
        4 = PRONOUN
        5 = [PRE]POSITION
        6 = [AR]TICLE
        7 = NOUN
        8 = PAST-TIME
        9 = FUTURE-TIME
    ____________________________________
    
    1 = ADVERB = NO-CONTRACT, 
    MODIFIER=CHANGE=MOTION=ACTION=FICTION = 1>1>1, 1>2, 1>3>4, 4<1>2, 4<1>3><4<1>2-DPV=DANGLING-PARTICIPAL-VERB. 
    "NO" = POSITION-MODIFICATION-AUTHORITY. = PERJURY 

    2 = VERB = FOR AN ACTION OF THE THINKING (IS-SINGULAR, ARE-PLURAL) 

    3 = ADJECTIVE = NO-CONTRACT-COLOR OF THE FICTION-OPINION = 1>3>4, 1>3>3>3>4, 3>4, 3<>4. 
    WHEN THE TWO-FACTS ARE WITH THE COMING- TOGETHER, 
    THEN THE 1st-FACT-MODIFIES WITH THE 2nd-FACT INTO THE (NO-FACT=PRONOUN) BY 
    THE 1st-COLOR OF THE OPINION-PREJUDICE. 

    4 = PRONOUN = 4, 1>3>4, 3>4, 4<1, 
    FOR THE VOID BY THE PRO=NO, NO=NO, UN=NO. 
    FOR NO CONTRACT OF THE TERMS OR OWNERSHIP ARE WITH THE VOID-CLAIM OF 
    THE (OBJECT-FACT = NO-CONTRACT-FACT). 

    5 = [PRE]POSITION = CORRECTION: POSITIONAL=TERMS/RULES = 5>6>7. 
    FOR, OF, WITH, BY, THROUGH, IN, [OUT] 

    6 = [AR]TICLE = LODIAL, AILING, CORRUPTION FROM THE BEGINNING. 
    :CORRECTION = LODIO, OWNER, 
    ORIGINAL-JURISDICTION. 5>6>7. A, AN, THE, THIS, THESE, THOSE, HIS, HER, MY, OUR. FOR 
    THE VOID OF THE ALL, ANY, OTHER, 

    7 = NOUN =NO-NO=VOID, 5>6>7. 
    :CORRECTION = KNOWN-(WITH A LINE OVER THE "OW")= FACT, OWN, KNOW, KNOWN, IN THE NOW-TIME. 

    8 = PAST-TIME = :FROM, ED, HAS, VOID-TIME-CONTINUANCE. 

    9 = FUTURE-TIME = :TO, 
    PRA, PRE, PRI, PRO, PRU, ETC.,= VOID-TIME-HAS NO-JURISDICTION, 
    OPINION, GUESS, TRIAL, EXPERIMENT, VOID OF CONCLUSIONS OR FACTS. 

    PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE: DANGLING PARTICIPLE: 
    You can't end a sentence in a verb and have it be correct, otherwise the sentence is "unfinished."

The Math Interface on Language helps anyone that wants to write in the 
correct sentence structure communication syntax with Mathematical precision eliminating subjective interpretation.

All law is based upon "adverb-verb" sentence structure communication syntax
(descriptive or rhetorical versus factual) and when such errors are pointed out with proper syntax 
then Judges, Attorneys, and other Officers of the Court have no choice but to recuse themselves and/or 
drop all charges or face criminal charges themselves.

QUANTUM-LANGUAGE-PARSE-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR is the technology made possible through the Math Interface on Language first discovered by :David-Wynn: Miller.
