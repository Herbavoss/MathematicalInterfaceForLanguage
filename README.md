Mathematical Interface For Language
================================

For The Mathematical Interface on Language we assign numbers to the 10 parts of sentence construction 
For The english language.

Use this interface to build parse-syntax-grammar enabled software solutions.  

This Mathematical Interface For Language will help those building correct sentence structure communication syntax tools

The Math Interface on Language helps anyone that wants to write in the correct communication  with Mathematical precision eliminating subjective interpretation;.
