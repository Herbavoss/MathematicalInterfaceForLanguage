Mathematical Interface For Language
================================

For The Mathematical Interface on Language we assign numbers to the 10 parts of sentence construction 
in the english language.

Use this interface to build parse-syntax-grammar enabled software solutions.  

This Mathematical Interface For Language will help those building correct sentence structure communication syntax tools

    0 = CONJUNCTION
    1 = ADVERB
    2 = VERB
    3 = ADJECTIVE
    4 = PRONOUN
    5 = [PRE]POSITION
    6 = [AR]TICLE
    7 = NOUN
    8 = PAST-TIME
    9 = FUTURE-TIME
